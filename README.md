# Take A Gulp
Take A Gulp is a Google Chrome Extension, which reminds the user to take a gulp of water every few minutes.  
Not everyone drinks a full glass of water and keeps track of it, some people just take a few gulps of water when they're drinking. So with this it will take it into account and remind the user to drink every few minutes, depending on the size of the gulp, of the goal and when the goal should be accomplished.
